## Introduction
A long time ago in the country far away, named Terra autem. A land inhabited by gnomes and mountain trolls, elves and dragons, kings and queens. Embossed out ancient candle magic and archaic black art.

Here King Roidur has ruled his country in peacetime for many years, and of the peace between the mountain troll and the kingdom a calm has settled over the population and not everyone was ready for what was growing underneath the mountains.

The small village of Villa Piscis is located right on the river and it takes two days by boat to get to the castle. Villa Piscis, where fishing and agriculture pass the time is where we meet our hero for the first time. "You" comes from a humble beginning, and everything you own is your farm, your boat and your animals. A stubborn heifer named Rivqah and the eager pig Emulus.
