## Escape by foot

Houses fall into the depths one by one while the trolls move quickly and aggressively. With swords and torches, they destroy the village in a single sweep. A few brave villagers have taken up arms while defending their fellow human beings. A young blacksmith named Lex sees you and shouts: â€œOver here! Hurry up!". Lex is armed with short swords in each hand, she signals that she is willing to give you one of them.
You get up from the masses and run faster than you have ever done before.

With your help the villagers' warriors can hold back the attackers long enough for most of the villagers to escape, but the threat is not over yet. Most of the black-troll army is there to take over the village and make it their own and in turn ruin the fishing stops here which supplies the entire royal city with fish and seafood

It's a four-day hike on foot to get to the castle, and the trolls' spies are well on their way to following you all the way there.

Halfway to the castle, Lex comes to you. "You fought bravely when we defended the village, are you going to join the king's army when we get to the castle?"

Answer 1: "Yes, I want to join the army and defend our land."

Answer 2: "No, I have to take me back and explore the caves from where the trolls came from."
