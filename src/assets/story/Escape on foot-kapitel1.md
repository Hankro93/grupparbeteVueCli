## Escape by foot

Houses fall into the depths one by one while the trolls move quickly and aggressively. With swords and torches, they destroy the village in a single sweep. A few brave villagers have taken up arms while defending their fellow human beings. A young blacksmith named Lex sees you and shouts: â€œOver here! Hurry up!". Lex is armed with short swords in each hand, she signals that she is willing to give you one of them.
You get up from the masses and run faster than you have ever done before.

With your help the villagers can hold back the attackers long enough for most of the villagers to escape. 
The village get abandoned and now a four-day hike on foot awaits before getting to the castle. 

You see a small childlike creature in the distans.

**Choice:**

1. _Will you interfere with this creature_
   
2. _Or will you ignore it?_
