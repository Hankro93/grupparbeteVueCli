## Escape by boat

The docks are seemingly untouched as of now so you run down towards the docks. Chaos ensues and fire roam all around you and the smoke covers the skies above.

You see a handful of people seeking shelter behind the boathouse. You quickly direct them to follow you towards your boat: “hurry! I have got a fishing boat out at the end of the docks”. 

It is 15 feet fishing boat with a big white sail. The group paddle out the boat and set sail.
Six boats got out of the docks that morning. A grim ambience lays over the group in the boats. Two days sailing to get to the king’s castle. 
Onboard the ship you connect with Ioanna. She tells you the story about her grandfather the late great wizard.  
“I can teach you a spell, light in the dimmest of darkness-spell, it will help you with your travels if you choose to go thru the caves.” She spoke.
"Will you join the kings army on arrival to the castle, or get back to the caves in search of the lost wizard Martinus?"

Answer 1: "Yes, I want to join the army and defend our land."

Answer 2: "No, I have to take me back and explore the caves from where the trolls came from."
