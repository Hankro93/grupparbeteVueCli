## Introduction

A long time ago in the country far away, named Terra autem. A land inhabited by gnomes and mountain trolls, elves and dragons, kings and queens. Embossed out ancient candle magic and archaic black art.

Here King Roid√ºr has ruled his country in peacetime for many years, and of the peace between the mountain troll and the kingdom a calm has settled over the population and not everyone was ready for what was growing underneath the mountains.

The small village of Villa Piscis is located right on the river and it takes two days by boat to get to the castle. Villa Piscis, where fishing and agriculture pass the time is where we meet our hero for the first time. "You" comes from a humble beginning, and everything you own is your farm, your boat and your animals. A stubborn heifer named Rivqah and the eager pig Emulus.

You wake up to a rumbling outside your cottage. Looking outside you see alot of animals running out from the woodlands. You dress yourself and head outside. Exiting your door you look over to your barn and hear frantic stomping inside.
You walk inside to find your usually calm and friendly pig Emulus walking around in his pen with what could only be described as a "frantic" look upon him. You climb over and crouch down to calm him down "Hey hey, whats wrong boy?" you ask him while stroking his back. He finally notices you're there and pushes his snout into your belly as if to push you out from the pen. Something big must be happening if all the animals are this riled up.

Walking outside you see a flash of light from the woods rising into the sky. You grab a pitchfork that's leaning against the barn and head over to investigate.

Upon reaching the place where the light shot up from you see a obelisk protruding from the earth with a preculiar sigil on it. You know these woods like your own backyard and this certainly has not been here all this time. Looking closer at the sigil you find a small protrusion on it. Something inside of you tells you to pull on it, unable to resist the temptation you do just that and something comes out. The sigil on the obelisk disappears and the thing you pulled out starts disintegrating into dust in your hand. A sharp pain radiates from your now dustfilled hand and you try to shake the dust off but it sticks like feathers on tar.
The pain intensifies and you scream in agony while looking at your hand. The dust seemingly enters your hand and and starts forming the same sigil that was once on the obelisk. After an intense experience that seemed to last for much longer than it actually did the pain dissapates and you're left with what looks like a black tattoo in the form of a hollow circle of flames.

You head back worse for wear and exhaustion starts consuming you. You almost fall asleep while walking but somehow manage to stave off the tiredness long enough for you to get back home.
