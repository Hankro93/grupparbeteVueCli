## Chapter 1: The destruction of Villa Pisci.

A strong rumble grows under the mountains and wakes the inhabitants. The earth's surface shakes as if thousands of feet were marching underground. A day that the wise but often overlooked magicians have feared.

You run out of your house, pitch-dark smoke seeping out of the mountain caves in the distance. The ground opens up from under you. You throw yourself quickly to the side only to see your farm destroyed in the landslide. The mountain troll has attacked the village from below, you do not have a chance. You have to escape!

"Escape to the Castle! Seek refuge with the king!"

**First choice:**

1. Escape in your boat, save as many as you can: Greater chance to quickly escape and survive the mountain troll's attack. Chance of population suffer greater losses.

2. Fly on foot and battle with trolls chasing your heels: Win the points of strength and luck. Longer journey to the castle.
