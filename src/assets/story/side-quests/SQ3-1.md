# Dragon Danger! (Fail)

You attempt to flee the dragon! You find yourself getting hotter by the second as the adrenaline floods your system. Hold on a second, why is the room getting so hot as well?

You hear the dragons deep laugh all too late as you realize that the room is actually on fire from his dragons breath. What will you do?

_Die._

_Die._
