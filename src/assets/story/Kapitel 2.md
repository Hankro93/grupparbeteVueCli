## Chapter 2: Battle in the King's Army or explore the caves unaided.

Upon arrival at the castle there is a glimmer of hope amongst the weary travelers. "Fear not for you're safe behind these walls, King Roid√ºr is a good man and he'll will come thru for his people" a billman comforts the knackered crowd while simultaneously ordering his subordinates to pick out battleworthy residents.

The king is looking out from the balcony connected to his throne room. Joined by Regis, the kings royal council,
"Years of peace and they choose to attack at this time. Sire, you may long have had enemies in the east that assume their might equals right. We should retaliate with the same means of attack." said Regis.

"should we not assume stupidity before we assume malevolence?"
spoke the king as he was lookin'down on the newley arrived villagers. "though what could a herd of goblins need with a fishing village? Last contact we had with these creatures they were just fine with thier accommodation in the mountain caves. altough crude creatures they still have an comprehension of kin and herd."

"Be that as it may sire, we'll still have to oppose this threat."

By this point the goblins in the east have had time to regroup their troops and are ready to set march to the castle. and you have a choice to make:

**Second choice:**

1. __Battle in the King's Army:__ *Gain points in strength and luck*

2. __Explore the caves unaided:__ *You'll gain points in agility and intellect*

Both options will grant you new armor.
