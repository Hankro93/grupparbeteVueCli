# The Black Phooka! (Success!)

You were successful. You grab your coin purse and weapon and head back to your camp.

As you reach the camp the sun starts to rise on the horizon and you pack your things and head out on the main road again.

You feel sore and tired after the night's escapades and lose 1 point in agility.

You leave the night behind you and continue along the road, an experience richer.
