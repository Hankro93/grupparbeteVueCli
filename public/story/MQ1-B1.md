## Escape by foot

Smoke fills your nostrils and splinters are blasted through the air coming from the houses falling into the depths. Meanwhile, the goblins charge ferociously through the village and violently swing their clubs trying to swat fleeing villagers like insects. With makeshift swords and torches, they blitz through the village like a hurricane, leaving only smouldering ruins and destruction in their wake.

A few brave souls have taken up arms in an attempt to buy some time for the other villagers to escape. The young blacksmith’s apprentice, Lex, sees you and shouts: “Over here! Hurry up!". Lex is armed with a short sword in each hand, she signals that she is willing to give you one of them. You get yourself away from the panicked masses and make your way over faster than you have ever done before.
