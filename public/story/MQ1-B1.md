## Escape by foot

Houses fall into the depths one by one while the trolls move quickly and aggressively. With swords and torches, they destroy the village in a single sweep. A few brave villagers have taken up arms while defending their fellow human beings. A young blacksmith named Lex sees you and shouts: â€œOver here! Hurry up!". Lex is armed with short swords in each hand, she signals that she is willing to give you one of them.
You get up from the masses and run faster than you have ever done before.
