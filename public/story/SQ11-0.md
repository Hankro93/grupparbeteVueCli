# Out of place&excl;

As you travel along the road you see a man. He seems stressed and does not really look like the adventurous type.
When you get closer the man approaches you.

> You there!. I could use your help.

He makes a short pause and looks a bit ashamed.

> I think I'm lost. No, I know I'm lost. Nothing looks familiar here and I mean at all. Oh I should've never left our camp. I know our camp is near a lake and we came into the forest from the North, but I have no idea where North is, I have no idea where anything is. Please, you've got to help me, help me find my way back to camp, I don't want to be in this forest anymore, I want to go home.

<!-- _Help him_
_Sorry im lost_ -->
