# The Ale-house!

You make your way to one of the city's many ale-houses. When you arrive you notice all the telltale markers of an old ale-house built before the city expanded. From the muddied ground outside filled with footsteps from prior patrons to the now crooked and aged sign hanging outside the door. The sign details a large boar with a flagon hanging in its mouth, the name _"The Drunken Boar"_ carved neatly into the wood.

As you open the door you are hit with a barrage of various fragrances and sounds. A larger crowd are laughing and cheering around a dice-table while a row of lone patrons are seated at the bar, each with their own flagon in front of them.
