# What hides in the deeps&excl;

You quickly pull up the line and at the end you have hooked, no fish, but a coin purse.

You open it and find 10 gold coins!

> Bah! Beginner's luck.

You continue fishing for a couple of hours before returning to port.

The man caught a couple of large fishes but no one such as the beast he described on the way out.

You share a hot meal with the man and he thanks for the help.
Then you venture back in towards the heart of the village.
