You jump over dead bodies and debris on your way over there. Lex hands over one of her swords and you fight of a couple of trolls aggressively.
The trolls are short but vile, they're fierce and bloodthirsty creatures who seem to crave this violence.
You fend of a couple of them whilst slaying another one with a swift blow to it's neck. 

With your help the villagers can hold back the attackers long enough for most of the villagers to escape. The village get abandoned and now a four-day hike on foot awaits before getting to the castle.
