The bear begins pacing in a circle around you, it movements heavy as if the very muscles will collapse under its own weight. You realize quite quickly that you are out of your depth and you have to get away. You make an attempt to flee, spinning around and taking your first step, but as if on command, the bear quickly dashes to face you. It is making it incredibly clear that you will not be able to flee from this situation. Your only option is to fight.
