You pull out your weapon and face the bear and join its circling. For each step you take, the bear matches you. As you move you notice that your movements are no longer sluggish or impaired from the obelisks power. It seems, at least for the moment, that the summoning of this beast has drained its power. The knowledge of this solidifies your resolve and you charge towards the bear, again, it matches you. It flies towards you, arms outstretched, ready to claw out your throat. You throw yourself to the ground, gliding on the grass, and swing your weapon towards its legs. A glancing blow, at best.

You are able to scramble to your legs just quick enough to dodge an oncoming barrage of swipes and the grasping tendrils from the bears neck. A gurgling growl is heard from its throat as it prepares for another attack. In your mind you can see how you can fell the beast in one move, however, it’s going to need quite a lot of luck and skill. It’s now or never.
