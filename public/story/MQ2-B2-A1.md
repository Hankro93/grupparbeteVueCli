You raise your weapon high and charge the goblins. They turn their attention to you, clearly not expecting someone to run at them in the darkness they are taken by surprise. Not only does one goblin falter and begin to flee, the old man seems to have found his courage and grabs a wooden plank nearby, promptly whacking one of the distracted goblins in the back of the head, knocking it out. The final goblin doesn’t know what to make of the situation and before it can react you are able to fell it with a swift blow to the head. After making sure that there are no goblins hiding anywhere you are embraced by the old man. Tears streaming down his face, he offers you anything he owns as payment for saving his life.

_“A horse? Well yes, of course!”_ He nods and scurries over to a barn connected to the main cottage. After a few minutes he returns with a white mare, kitted with saddle and a sack strapped to its side. _“Please, I offer you my most prized mare. Her name is Bessie, take good care of her. I have also packed a weapon for you, I hope it can help you more than it can help me.”_ With that, you seat yourself in the saddle and begin your ride to the black obelisk.
