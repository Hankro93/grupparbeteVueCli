# Goblin Encounter! (Success)

The goblin childs face lights up at the sight of a golden coin, seemingly never having seen one before. It pockets it and gives you a broad, toothy smile before it runs away.

Satisfied with the result you can now choose to go to the nearest inn or continue to the next city. What will you do?

<!-- _Go to the city._

_Go to the inn._ -->
