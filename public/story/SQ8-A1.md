# Flowers in her hair

You help the girl up the tree so she can get her basket down. She also takes the opportunity to pick some of the flowers that she attaches to her long blonde braided hair before she climbs down again. Once on the ground, her eyes shines and she says:

> Thank Thou mister it was most kind of Thou. Take this glass jar of fireflies that can help Thou light Thy way in the dark as a thank Thou for Thy help.

You continue on your journey pleased with your choice and leave the Elvish girl behind you.
