# The Black Phooka! (Fail!)

Just when you reach your coin purse. The yellow eyes appear and the creature bites your hand. You flinch and the creature jumps out of the tree trunk
and changes shape into a Raven and flies away with your coins. You do not have a chance to follow so you head back through the forest to your campsite.

As you reach the camp the sun starts to rise on the horizon and you pack your things and head out on the main road again.

You feel a little disappointed that you lost half of your coins and your body feels sore and tired after the night's escapades.

You lose 1 point in agility.

You leave the night behind you and continue along the road, an experience richer.
