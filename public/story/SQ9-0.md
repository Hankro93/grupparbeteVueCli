# The Black Phooka!

The sun begins to set on the horizon and you find a small glade not too far from the main road where you decide to make camp.
After collecting some firewood. You sit down and watch the last daylight disappear before drifting off to sleep.

You wake up to something rummaging through your things. The fire has burned out and only a narrow shard of the moon is visible in the sky. It is a black creature with bright yellow eyes, long ears and a tail, It is quite ugly. You exclaim "Hey what are you doing!" The creature that now has a firm grip on your coin purse gets scared, jumps up and loses half of your coins before it disappears in the dark and into the woods with the remaining coins.

The creature reminds you of a Phooka, a creature / spirit that is said to bring both good and bad fortune.

You decide to:

<!-- _Chase after the creature._
_Collect your items._
