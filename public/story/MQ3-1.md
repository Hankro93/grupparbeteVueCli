# Chapter 3
The wind howled and blew a bitter chill piercing through your cloak. What was once a lush, green forest teeming with life seemed now hollow. The trees had had the life sucked from their roots, leaving a blanket of dead leaves on the ground, and their branches clawing at the sky like bony fingers reaching for the light of the moon. You make your way through the winding maze of trees until you feel a spike of pain in your hand. The black flame on your hand feels like it’s on fire and you can feel a vibrating hum in the air. You scramble around until finally you see it. The black obelisk. It has doubled in size since you last saw it, instead of this curious rock you first saw, there now stands an imposing font of power. Beside it you see the shape of what looks like a hooded child, muttering under his breath. 

You try to get closer but you feel like the obelisk is physically pushing you away, as if the ground itself were transforming into mud under your very feet. Suddenly you feel a heavy gaze upon you and when you look up you see the child has turned around and from underneath the hood you see a pair of bright yellow eyes, glowing with power. “So... The chosen sacrifice has finally returned.” A raspy voice echoes through the air. “I will be honest, I did not account for you to be foolish enough to return.” He continues. “I suppose it is what I should come to expect from a human.”
