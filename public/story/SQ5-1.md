# The inn

As you enter the buildning you find yourself almost overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle, patrons are drinking and seem to be enjoying their time after a long days labor. A maid can be seen rushing between the tables, collecting plates, mugs, and taking new orders at a speed you don't quite think you could manage. Behind the reception you can see several tapped ale-barrels and a hearty woman greets you with a wide grin.

> "Welcome darlin'! What can I get you?"
