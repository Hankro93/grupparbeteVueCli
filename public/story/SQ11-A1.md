# Out of place&excl;

You recognize that you have crossed a lake not too far from the place where the man is. Together you head back to the lake and after a while the man exclaims.

> There! There's my camp. Wait here!

The man hurries into his tent and rummages around for a while before coming back to you.

> You understand I'm in transit to sell my goods. But I've been cheated of all my money, those goblins are not to be played with. So I can 't offer you any coins.

> However, I want to give you this weapon as a thank you for helping me find my way back to my camp.

You receive the weapon and bid the man farewell. To head back out onto the main road.
