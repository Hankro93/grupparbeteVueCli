## Chapter 1: The destruction of Villa Pisci.

Finally, you arrive at a bridge, aptly namely “Somber Stream Bridge”, and row ashore. The elderly man jumps into the water and walks up to a nearby sign. You tie your boat to a stone under the bridge and walk up to him, looking at the sign.

> **"Town of Innswood"**  
> **"Lothric Castle"**

_"Where are you going to go?"_

The man looks to you and points at the sign saying **"Town of Innswood"**.

You tell him somebody needs to let the king know what has happened as soon as possible and he points to the sign saying **“Lothric Castle”**. You understand what you must do and bid him farewell. As you turn around the old man runs up to you and tugs on your coat. He shoves a bag into your arms, hugs you tightly, and promptly turns around making his way over the bridge.

Opening the bag reveals 5 coins. You feel a sense of relief and yell "Thank you!", grinning, you head off towards **Lothric Castle**.
