Upon reaching the place where the light shot up from you see a obelisk protruding from the earth with a preculiar sigil on it. You know these woods like your own backyard and this certainly has not been here all this time. Looking closer at the sigil you find a small protrusion on it. Something inside of you tells you to pull on it, unable to resist the temptation you do just that and something comes out. The sigil on the obelisk disappears and the thing you pulled out starts disintegrating into dust in your hand. A sharp pain radiates from your now dustfilled hand and you try to shake the dust off but it sticks like feathers on tar.

The pain intensifies and you scream in agony while looking at your hand. The dust seemingly enters your hand and and starts forming the same sigil that was once on the obelisk. After an intense experience that seemed to last for much longer than it actually did the pain dissapates and you're left with what looks like a black tattoo in the form of a hollow circle of flames.

You head back, worse for wear and exhaustion starts consuming you. You almost fall asleep while walking but somehow manage to stave off the tiredness long enough for you to get back home.
