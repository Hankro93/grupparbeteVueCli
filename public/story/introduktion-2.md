You are abruptly awoken to a loud rumbling coming from outside your cottage walls. Swiftly, you rush to the window and while, at first glance, you don’t notice much, as a few moments pass you begin to see a flood of animals pouring out from the woodland border. You hurriedly dress yourself and head outside. Exiting your door you are met by a cacophony of noises, looking over to your barn you are able to pick up the panicked stomping of your animals. You head inside to find your usually calm and friendly pig, Eumulus, rushing around in his pen with what could only be described as a "frantic" look upon him. You climb over the fence separating him and the equally distressed Rivqah and try to calm him down.

"Hey hey, what’s wrong boy?" You ask him while trying to stroke his back in an attempt to calm him down. Finally, he notices your presence and pushes his snout into your belly as if to push you out of the pen. Something big must be happening if all the animals are this riled up.

As you managed to somewhat calm the animals down you make your way outside and are temporarily blinded pillar of light rising from deep in the woods into the sky. You quickly grab a pitchfork that's leaning against the barn and head over to investigate.
