# Abandoned House! (Success)

The abandoned house is truly abandoned. However, you do find a small box filled with a satchel of silver coins and a weapon. You pocket the coins and fit the weapon to your belt.

Satisfyed with the result you can now choose to go to the nearest inn or continue to the next city. What will you do?

<!-- _Go to the city._
