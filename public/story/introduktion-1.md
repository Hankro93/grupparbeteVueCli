## Introduction

A long time ago in a land far, far away, there was a country named Terra Autem. In this land lived the smallest of gnomes and tallest of mountain trolls, the fairest of elves and mightiest of dragons, even the nobility of humans were scattered in flourishing cities and harbours. Teeming with life, you could almost touch the ancient magic rooted in the land.

Here the great King Roidür has ruled for many years, with a fragile peace between the mountain trolls and the kingdom of men solidifying more and more for each passing season. Nobody was ready for the growing darkness lurking beneath the mountains.

A two days ride from the great King Roidür’s castle lies a small village of Villa Piscis located just by the river. Villa Piscis, where the toils of fishing and agriculture pass the time, is where we meet our hero for the first time. "You" come from humble beginnings, and all you have to your name is a farm, a boat, and two animals. A stubborn heifer named Rivqah and the eager pig named Emulus.
