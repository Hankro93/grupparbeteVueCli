# Dragon Danger!

Deep in the mines of Lanicam you find yourself surrounded by heaps and piles of treasure. The ground you walk on glitters like stars in the sky, even the stale air has a smell of untouched gold. As you begin to fill your pockets you hear a rumble from the earth and a voice seems to burst from the walls:

> "A thief roams my halls, what business have you with my gold, greedy one? Is your life worth so little?"

Suddenly a dragon the size of a house descends on you leaving you little time to make your next move. What will you do?

<!-- _Flee, dropping three quarters of the riches you have stolen._

_Face the dragon with your vast intelligence, telling him that riches of the ground are riches for the people._ -->
