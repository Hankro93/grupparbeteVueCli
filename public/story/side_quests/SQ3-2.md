# Dragon Danger! (Success!)

Your attempt to debate the dragon seems to have worked, or at least, confused it enough to grant you some respite giving you enough time to fill your pockets with another satchel of gold.
Taking this opportunity, as the dragon is seemingly having an internal monologue, you flee the mines and find yourself at the entrance when you hear another rumble from the ground.

> "Hold on, where did you go, greedy one? Drat, I have been tricked once again. You win this time!"

Satisfyed with the result you can now choose to go to the nearest inn or continue to the next city. What will you do?

<!-- _Go to the city._
