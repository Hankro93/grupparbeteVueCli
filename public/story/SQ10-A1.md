# What hides in the deeps&excl;

You answer the old man: “Sure. It will be a nice change of scenery.”

You jump in the boat and help the man lay out.
The water is calm and the weather is beautiful. Once you arrive at the fishing place, the man has already told several of his old fishing stories. As everyone ends up, that incredibly big fish that he caught tears and disappears into the depths.

The man is very determined when he throws out. He will catch that bastard.

> I will show you that the beast is real!

You bait your fishing rod and throw out your line. While listening to the man.

The fishing rod jerks!

> You’ve Caught something!

<!-- _Roll dice for luck_ -->
