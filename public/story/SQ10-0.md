# What hides in the deeps!

You wander around the town / village and pass the local harbor. There is full activity where goods change owners and the fishing boats are loaded and unloaded.
The chatter that fills the air makes it difficult to distinguish other sounds.

Suddenly you hear a shrill voice cutting through the chatter.

> Hey! Hey you there! You look like a sturdy fella.

You look around and search for the source of the voice and see a weather-beaten slightly older fisherman.

The man is standing on the deck of a slightly smaller fishing boat than the other boats.
You hurry over to the man. He asks you if you would like to help him.

> You see I’ve hurt my hand and can’t operate Astraea with only one hand. Could you help an old fisherman out? In exchange for your help you can keep anything you catch.

Do you go out fishing with the man?
