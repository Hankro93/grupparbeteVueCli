# The dead don't speak&excl;

Sensible move. You see, it was just a dirty dog ​​wanting to say hello. It happily barks and licks your face while its tail could have whipped the dead to life.

You see a shadow pass in the corner of your eye and feel observed.

You look around a bit in the croft with the dog notch in the heel. But you will find nothing of interest.

Looks like there's no treasure hidden here.

You pat the dog and give it a bite to eat before you turn around to walk to the front door.

Suddenly there is now a house boggart in your way.

He smiles and knocks three times on the door frame and a hidden door opens next to you.

<!-- _Dice roll for luck_ -->
