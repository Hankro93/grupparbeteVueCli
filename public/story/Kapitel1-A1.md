You run towards the man and say "I have a boat close by, if you value your life you should come with me". The man just nods and runs after you.

You reach the river with the man not far behind and start untying the rope holding it to the shore. The man catches up and jumps unto the boat. You finish untying the rope and jumps onboard and start rowing away from the smoking village.

You ask the man what happened to which he doesn't answer. You look quizzically at him and ask if he's hurt? he swings his head left to right and gesticulates towards his mouth. Are you mute old man? He nods and bows his head as to try and apologize for being unable to help you. You row until you can't see the smoke anymore and finally start to relax somewhat.
