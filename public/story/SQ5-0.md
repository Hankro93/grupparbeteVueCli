# The inn

You arrive at the inn. Before you is a quaint, welcoming buildning eminating the scent of a burning log fire and roasted pork. Laughter can be heard through the open windows and you can feel the energy pouring into the evening air.

As you enter the buildning you find yourself almost overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle, patrons are drinking and seem to be enjoying their time after a long days labor. A maid can be seen rushing between the tables, collecting plates, mugs, and taking new orders at a speed you don't quite think you could manage. Behind the reception you can see several tapped ale-barrels and a hearty woman greets you with a wide grin.

> "Welcome darlin'! What can I get you?"
