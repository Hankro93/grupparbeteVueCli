# The inn

You arrive at the inn. Before you is a quaint, welcoming buildning eminating the scent of a burning log fire and roasted pork. Laughter can be heard through the open windows and you can feel the energy pouring into the evening air. A burly, bearded, grimy man stands infront of the door, as you approach him he queries:

> If'n yer thinkin' o' goin' inside, ye better show us some gold, ya hear me?
