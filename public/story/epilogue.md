# Epilogue

A long time ago in a land far, far away, there was a country named Terra Autem. In this land lived the smallest of gnomes and tallest of mountain trolls, the fairest of elves and mightiest of dragons, even the nobility of humans were scattered in flourishing cities and harbours. Once, it was teeming with life and the ancient magic could be felt in the smallest of things.

Now, a threat looms over the land. An evil so foul, even the mountain-dwellers shudder to say her name. She walks among all manner of things, spreading her bile to the farthest reaches to the deepest depths.

Her name: Avalon.
