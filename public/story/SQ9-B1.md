# The Black Phooka&excl;

You've heard tales of The Black Phooka and the misfortune they bring. Not sure where the creature went you collect the rest of your belongings and put a new log on the fire. With the remaining coins in safe custody under your head, you go back to sleep.

_a couple of hours later..._

The sun is rising on the horizon and you pack your things and head out on the main road again.

You feel a little disappointed that you lost half of your coins. You leave the night behind you and continue along the road, an experience richer.
