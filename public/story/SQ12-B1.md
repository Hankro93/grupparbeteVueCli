# The dead don't speak!

First, the group becomes quiet when you come over. But after you have introduced yourself and told that you have not heard of the croft, the conversation quickly starts again.

> I'm saying that the croft is haunted! Nay one Hath lived Thither for ages and Thou can still see light in the windows in the Eveningtide. Thither Art even people who have disappeared when they went Thither to investigate the whole thing.

> Nay it is not haunted but Thither is an old treasure map hidden in the house. The old lady who lived Thither was rich as a troll and hid her fortune as she did not want her greedy descendants to partake of the money.

What are you doing?

<!-- _No way I'm visiting a haunted house!_
_ Treasures and riches have captured your interest._-->
