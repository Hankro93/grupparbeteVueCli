# Bandits&excl;

The nature around you has suddenly become very quiet. You have a gnawing feeling that someone is watching you. You try to shake off the thought and move on.
Suddenly there are three masked men standing in front of you. Everyone of the bandits are properly armed.

> It's a toll for you to get through here! Give us all your valuables and we will let you pass unharmed!

Says the biggest of the bandits while smiling scornfully.

<!-- _Give the bandits all your coins_
_Attack Bandits!_ -->
