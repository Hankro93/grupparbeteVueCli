# The Black Phooka&excl;

Without thinking, you throw yourself up and rush after the creature through the darkness. After a while, you glimpse the black long tail as it dives into a large dead and hollow tree.

You sneak forward and look down into the tree.

There you see the handle of a weapon that you carefully pick up and there a little further down in the tree trunk, your coins glisten in the dim moonlight that has found its way down. You can not see the creature anywhere and reach for your coins.

<!-- Roll for luck_ -->
