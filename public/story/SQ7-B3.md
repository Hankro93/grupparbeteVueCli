# Bandits! (Fail)

All three bandits attack at the same time and the smallest of them wields a large wooden club. He gets a full hit in your head. Everything turns black and you faint.

When you wake up again, the bandits have disappeared. They have taken everything you own except your shirt, underpants and shoes (Thank God you are not completely naked). Dizzy and blown away, you get up, brush off the dust and continue on your way.
