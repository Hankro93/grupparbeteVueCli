# Bandits&excl;

You choose to give up all your coins in the hope that the bandits will let you through unscathed.

The bandits grab your coin purse and laugh out loud before stepping aside and gesturing that you are allowed to continue on the road.

In great shame, you hurry past the bandits, but at the same time you feel relieved that you escaped unscathed.
