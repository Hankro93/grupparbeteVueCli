# The Ale-house!

As you slide up onto a bar stool you are met by a stout man with a thick, auburn beard, clad in basic linen clothing, and a dirty apron. He eyes you up and down as he cleans a flagon with a greasy cloth his coarse voice and heavy accent is hard to make out through the bustle of the tavern.

> "Ah! Welcom' t' th' Drunken Boar, o'sider. Ca' I get a' ale fer ye'? 'Tis but a gold fer th' drink."

The bartender seems to be asking if you want to purchase an ale for a gold piece. From behind you catch the locals discussing something about trolls, although you can't hear exactly what.

<!--_Order an ale and ask the bartender about local rumours._
    _Change your mind and go back to the harbor._-->
