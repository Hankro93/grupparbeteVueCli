After relaying your account of the events to the king and his court you are respectfully discharged from the room. After walking through the streets of the city you arrive at the city market. Looking around, you can see sellers trying to shoo some of the newly arrived refugees from their stalls. _“If ya ain’t got the coin for it then scram!”_ A moustached seller screams at a young woman passing by his stall, glancing at the cabbages he has for sale. The lady is in tattered clothing and seemed to be either a vagrant or a refugee, although you don’t recognize her from Villa Pisci. She looks to be on the verge of tears when she finally hurries away from the market.

The mark on your hand burns at the sight before you, a painful reminder of the day you found the black obelisk in the forest near your old home. Could it truly be so that you are part of the cause of this calamity, simply for touching the obelisk? The question has been racking your brain since the day the goblins attacked. Despite all your attempts at reasoning, there is truly only one way to find out. You must go back to where this all began, back to the black obelisk. A simple enough task made much harder when the city is promptly set into lockdown due to the imminent goblin attack.
