# Chapter 1: The destruction of Villa Pisci

The wind shrieks like a child in pain coupled with a heavy rumble akin to an army of thousands marching and beating their heavy war-drums. The very ground shakes as the sounds grow louder, all emanating from the mountain range. The day had finally come, the day that the wise but often overlooked magicians and mystics had prophesized for years, but not had the power or influence to stop.

You had experienced a similar day many years ago, however, this time there is no alluring light to tempt your curiosity. You run out of your house at once seeing the cause of all the commotion. Pitch-black smoke seep out of the mountain range in the distance, covering the sky in a blanket of darkness. Suddenly, the very ground beneath you cracks and opens. You are able to throw yourself quickly to the side only to see your farm destroyed in a landslide, burying everything you own to an instant. A goblin herd has crawled out from its caverns and attacked the village, at this point you do not have a chance. You have to escape!

_"Escape to the Castle! Seek refuge with the king!"_
