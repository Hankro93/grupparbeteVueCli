# The dead dont speak! (Fail)

You look inside and see a really old document lying curled up.
Carefully remove the roll and open it.

What was once written on the roll has faded away by age and the paper crumbles in your hands. This was probably the map to the treasure mentioned.

A little disappointed, you leave the croft and neither the dog nor the boggarten can be seen anymore. You head back towards the city.
