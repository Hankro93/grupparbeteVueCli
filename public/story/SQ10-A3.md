# What hides in the deeps!

Well you’ve caught a log. Impressive…

You fish for a couple of hours but the fish won’t bite today.
The man caught a small one before he said.

> Hm it must be something that creates an imbalance in nature. The fish always bites well here. Lets head back to port.

When you reach the port, you share a meal. And the man thanks so much for the help.
He wishes you better luck on your quest than you have in fishing luck.

Then you venture back in towards the heart of the village.
