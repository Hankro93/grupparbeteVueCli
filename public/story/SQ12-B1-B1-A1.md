# The dead don't speak&excl;

A small creature, no larger than a small large dog leaps forward and goes to attack.

You attack!

You hear a pitiful growl as the beast flees and realizes that you have just planned on killing a dirty poodle.

Surprised by what has just happened, you do not notice that the croft has not been uninhabited and that the boggart who lives there has seen everything that has happened.

Outraged, he now goes to attack with his cane and you start fleeing the croft.

Witch way do you choose?
