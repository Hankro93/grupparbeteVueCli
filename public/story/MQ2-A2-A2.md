Two days later you find yourself walking in the company of the now discharged Colin, your former officer. He approached you after the battle was over to offer you congratulations, he seemed impressed with your behaviour during the battle. _“Cowards have no place in this beautiful land, I am glad you showed your bravery out there.”_ He had said, patting you on the back. Now the two of you had finally collected your pay from the field office, adding 10 gold coins to your coffer. Additionally, Colin was able to talk you up as a leading part of the second line of defence, giving you an additional 2 gold for a total of 12 gold.

You thanked Colin earnestly for all he had done, however, there was only little time to celebrate. The ache you feel in your hand had not dissipated after the battle. If anything, it had only gotten worse. You pack your bags, strap your new sword to your belt, and hang your shield over your back. It is time to make your way back to where it all began. Back to the black obelisk.
